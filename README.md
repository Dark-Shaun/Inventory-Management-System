## Overview

The **Personalized Inventory Management System** is an internal software solution I developed for **Renuka Pharma**, tailored to meet the company's specific inventory management requirements. By integrating advanced personalization techniques, the system adapts to the behaviors and preferences of individual users, optimizing inventory processes and enhancing the overall user experience. 

This system leverages **Django** as the primary backend framework, along with a suite of modern tools for frontend, database management, and deployment. The personalized approach ensures each user has a custom experience, which reduces friction, increases operational efficiency, and streamlines the management of Renuka Pharma's large and diverse inventory.

The software was designed to address unique challenges within the pharmaceutical industry, such as monitoring inventory for sensitive medications, forecasting demand for medical supplies, and ensuring compliance with industry regulations. By utilizing real-time data and machine learning models, the system enhances decision-making, reduces waste, and improves the overall responsiveness of inventory management.

This invetory database is being used for creating multiple reporting dashboard for business use in future.
